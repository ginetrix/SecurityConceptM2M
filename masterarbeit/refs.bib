A comprehensive approach: framework, method, and modelling language},

        abstract = {In this thesis, an approach for designing secure enterprise architectures is proposed. Both security and enterprise architecture discipline could potentially benefit from this approach. From a security perspective, the likelihood that security requirements will be addressed throughout the enterprise could be increased. From an enterprise architecture perspective, the intended benefits are expected to be realized by providing a holistic view on the organisation where security is adequately addressed. This is demanded, because the impact of security on the organisation is still growing.
The approach to designing secure enterprise architectures as developed in this thesis consists of three elements: a framework, a method, and a modelling language. The framework is described by the relation of the Zachman and SABSA framework. The method is comprised of an integration between the TOGAF ADM and SABSA Lifecycle. The modelling language is completed by an ArchiMate extension including the concepts vulnerability, threat, risk, security mechanism, and security policy.

Experts from the enterprise architecture and security discipline were interviewed to validate the proposed approach. Overall, the approach is considered to be both usable and useful. Also, the appropriate constructs are deemed to be included in the modelling language to support security modelling in enterprise architecture.}
