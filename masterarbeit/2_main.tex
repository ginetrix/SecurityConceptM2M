\section{Background}

Prior to addressing the actual approach and implementation some concepts and terms have to be introduced. Firstly, the term \textit{security concept}, as it is used throughout the thesis, is being described. A definition of \textit{granularity levels} and system abstraction follows. Lastly, a section covers \textit{model transformations} and \textit{aggregation rules} on security attributes.
